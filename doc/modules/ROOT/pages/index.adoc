= Active Directory authentication

This guide will get you started with the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Kerberos authentication
in Microsoft Active Directory domains.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide, you will learn how to configure Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise to authenticate
to cluster members and clients using Kerberos tickets in Microsoft Active Directory domain.

== Prerequisites

- Hazelcast Enterprise and its License Key (You can ask for a trial license through the https://hazelcast.com/get-started/#deploymenttype-imdg[license form]).
- Active Directory server (AD) and the 2nd Windows server connected in the Active Directory domain
include::{templates-url}/microservices/prerequisites.adoc[]

=== Active Directory domain in MS Azure
If you don't have Active Directory domain configured in your environment, you can provision
one in MS Azure. There is an Azure deployment template on GitHub which
starts a domain for you on few clicks:

* https://github.com/maxskunkworks/TLG/tree/master/tlg-base-config_3-vm

== Environment

The sample environment used in this guide contains 2 Windows servers

- Domain controller with Active Directory (hostname: `dc1`)
- Application server attached to the domain (hostname: `app1`)

Hazelcast connections are based on IP addresses, so they will be also necessary in the
Kerberos authentication configuration.

Following addresses are used our environment:

[source]
----
10.0.0.10 dc1
10.0.0.11 app1
----

You have to replace the hostname and IP values to fit your environment in commands
and Hazelcast configuration files used in this guide.

== Create member accounts in Active Directory

We will use the PowerShell on the Domain controller to create an Active Directory
user account for each Hazelcast member.
We don't need to provide passwords, Active Directory will generate random ones for us.
We will also need a keytab file for each member.
Keytab files will contain the password as a shared secret used for authentication and Kerberos
ticket verification.

[source,powershell]
----
New-ADUser -Name hz-app1 -PasswordNotRequired $True `
  -PasswordNeverExpires $True -PassThru -Enabled $True
ktpass -princ hz/10.0.0.11@ACME.com -mapuser hz-app1@ACME.COM `
  -out hz-app1.keytab +rndPass -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL

New-ADUser -Name hz-dc1 -PasswordNotRequired $True `
  -PasswordNeverExpires $True -PassThru -Enabled $True
ktpass -princ hz/10.0.0.10@ACME.com -mapuser hz-dc1@ACME.COM `
  -out hz-dc1.keytab +rndPass -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
----

Copy the newly generated `hz-app1.keytab` file from the domain controller
to the application server.

== Configure Hazelcast members

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../../hazelcast.yml[]
----

== Configure Hazelcast Client

[source,powershell]
----
New-ADServiceAccount -Name hztest -Enabled $true -RestrictToSingleComputer
Add-ADComputerServiceAccount -Identity APP1 -ServiceAccount hztest
Install-ADServiceAccount -Identity hztest
----
